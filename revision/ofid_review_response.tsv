R1	The variables chosen to quantify severity are potentially imprecise.	The reviewer is correct, and we have emphasized this weakness in the discussion. We had attempted to address the imprecision of each severity definition by testing several different definitions. As suggested below, we have further expanded this sensitivity analysis approach to include the subject's location, as location might also reflect disease severity.	Discussion, second paragraph.
R1	Could the 7-day [CT infiltrate] window be too broad? Alternatively, the authors could consider providing an explanation for why 7 days was chosen	We have added justification for why the 7-day interval was chosen.	Methods, third paragraph ("Clinical Data Collection").
R1	Could it have been more inclusive if CXR changes were included? It may have been that the CXR findings were significant enough for the clinical team to not obtain a CT scan, for consideration that no additional information would be gained and/or for infection control purposes	We have added to the Methods section an explanation of why CT scans were chosen over CXRs.	Methods, third paragraph ("Clinical Data Collection").
R1	Second detail that might be worth discussion is the generalizability of the results. Among commercially available COVID tests, not all perform the B-actin gene detection.	This is an important point and we have revised the Discussion to better acknowledge the diversity of specimen quality markers.	Discussion, third paragraph.
R1	Clarify when during the pandemic the samples obtained.	We have better emphasized the period of collection in the Methods section.	Methods, first paragraph ("Study Design, Setting, and Population") and Table 1.
R1	Provide a breakdown of the positives according to the populations described in the settings section... Consider if population setting analysis as another surrogate of disease severity, could further fortify the conclusion that the specimen quality and not disease severity, is the main driver of the association between viral and B-actin CT values.	As suggested, we have added an analysis of specimen source setting to supplement our other sensitivity analyses focused on disease severity.	Results, fourth paragraph ("Impact of Disease Severity on Relationship Between β-Actin and SARS-CoV-2 Cycle Threshold").
R1	Consider including a comment in the limitations that patient level factors that may impact NP viral shedding but were not accounted for and might warrant additional research, such as comorbid conditions, immunocompromise status, and duration of illness.	We appreciate this suggestion and have added the suggested limitations and future directions to the discussion.	Discussion, second paragraph.
R2	The authors provide the analytic cutoff for calling a sample positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and the acceptable cutoff of the MS2 phage control. What was the acceptable range of Ct values for the beta-actin target in the assay?	We thank the reviewer for catching this oversight. We hae added cutoff and acceptable ranges to the Methods section.	Methods, fourth paragraph ("Specimen Collection, Processing, and RT-PCR Assay")
R2	I find Figure 1 confusing and, if I am interpreting it correctly, there are redundancies in the panels of the matrix.	We apologize for the confusion created by the matrix plot. We have replace it in the main text with a table, which distills the data more clearly (Table 1). In case readers want to examine the data at a more granular level, we have retained the matrix plot as a supplemental figure (Supplemental Figure 1).	Results, first paragraph ("SARS-CoV-2 Detection and Cycle Threshold Range") and Table 1.
R2	There were limited data available on subjects for oxygen saturation and CT chest imaging results. The proportions presented were for all patients, but it might be of interest to the reader to know also the proportion of patients that were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in which those data were available as well	As suggested, we have added the proportion of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA cases who had a measure of disease severity.	Results, fourth paragraph ("Impact of Disease Severity on Relationship Between β-Actin and SARS-CoV-2 Cycle Threshold").
