  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The need for the timely collection of diagnostic
              biosamples during symptomatic episodes represents a major
              obstacle to large-scale studies on acute respiratory infection
              (ARI) epidemiology. This may be circumvented by having the
              participants collect their own nasal swabs. We compared self- and
              staff-collected swabs in terms of swabbing quality and detection
              of viral respiratory pathogens. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:
              We conducted a prospective study among employees of our
              institution during the ARI season 2010/2011 (December-March).
              Weekly emails were sent to the participants (n = 84), reminding
              them to come to the study center in case of new symptoms. The
              participants self-collected an anterior nasal swab from one
              nostril, and trained study personnel collected one from the other
              nostril. The participants self-collected another two swabs (one
              from each nostril) on a subsequent day. Human $\beta$-actin DNA
              concentration was determined in the swabs as a quality control.
              Viral respiratory pathogens were detected by multiplex RT-PCR
              (Seeplex RV15 kit, Seegene, Eschborn, Germany). Of 84
              participants, 56 (67\%) reported at least one ARI episode, 18
              participants two, and one participant three. Self-swabbing was
              highly accepted by the participants. The amount of $\beta$-actin
              DNA per swab was higher in the self- than in the staff-collected
              swabs (p = 0.008). $\beta$-actin concentration was lower in the
              self-swabs collected on day 1 than in those collected on a
              subsequent day (p<0.0001). A respiratory viral pathogen was
              detected in 31\% (23/75) of staff- and in 35\% (26/75) of
              self-collected swabs (p = 0.36). With both approaches, the most
              frequently identified pathogens were human rhinoviruses A/B/C
              (12/75 swabs, 16\%) and human coronavirus OC43 (4/75 swabs, 5\%).
              There was almost perfect agreement between self- and
              staff-collected swabs in terms of pathogen detection (agreement =
              93\%, kappa = 0.85, p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Nasal
              self-swabbing for identification of viral ARI pathogens proved to
              be equivalent to staff-swabbing in this population in terms of
              acceptance and pathogen detection.",

                 emerged in China in late December 2019 and has spread
                 worldwide. Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive sense,
                 single-stranded RNA viruses and employ a complicated pattern
                 of virus genome length RNA replication as well as
                 transcription of genome length and leader containing
                 subgenomic RNAs. Although not fully understood, both
                 replication and transcription are thought to take place in
                 so-called double-membrane vesicles in the cytoplasm of
                 infected cells. We here describe detection of SARS-CoV-2
                 subgenomic RNAs in diagnostic samples up to 17 days after
                 initial detection of infection, provide evidence for their
                 nuclease resistance and likely protection by cellular
                 membranes consistent with being part of virus-induced
                 replication organelles. Furthermore, we show that the ratios
                 of genomic to subgenomic RNA as well as the ratios of plus to
                 negative strand RNA of genomic and subgenomic RNA are
                 consistent with what have been detected for other
                 coronaviruses in cell culture; albeit with the caveat that in
                 vivo diagnostic samples, even in relatively early infection,
                 the ratios of these RNAs are most reminiscent of late culture,
                 semi-purified virus preparations shown to have a relatively
                 constant ratio of genomic to subgenomic RNAs of around 5-10 or
                 higher, while the ratios of positive to negative strands are
                 more than 100 for the genomic RNA and around 20 for the
                 subgenomic RNAs. Overall, our results may help explain the
                 extended PCR positivity of some samples, and may also, at
                 least in part, help explain discrepancies in results of
                 different diagnostic PCR methods described by others; in
                 particular for samples with a low virus load or of poor
                 quality. Overall, we present evidence that subgenomic RNAs may
                 not be an indicator of active coronavirus
                 replication/infection, but that these RNAs, similar to the
                 virus genome RNA, may be rather stable, and thus detectable
                 for an extended period, most likely due to their close
                 association with cellular membranes.",

              respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) and represents a
              global pandemic affecting more than 26 million people and has
              claimed >870,000 lives worldwide. Diagnostic tests for SARS-COV-2
              infection commonly use nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS). As an
              alternative specimen, we investigated the potential use of the
              real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) detection of
              SARS-COV-2 in saliva samples in large suspected-COVID-19 patients
              in Kuwait. NPS and saliva samples pairs were prospectively
              collected from 891 COVID-19 suspected patients in Kuwait and
              analyzed using TaqPath™ COVID-19 multiplex RT-PCR. Of the 891
              patients, 38.61 \% (344/891) were positive for SARS-CoV-2, 4.83
              \% (43/891) were equivocal, and 56.56 \% (504/891) were negative
              with NPS by RT-PCR. For saliva, 34.23 \% (305/891) were positive
              for SARS-CoV-2, 3.14 (28/891) were equivocal, and 62.63 \%
              (558/891) were negative. From 344 confirmed cases for SARS-CoV-2
              with NPS samples, 287 (83.43 \%) (95 \% CI, 79.14-86.99) were

              number of quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assays have been
              developed to identify SARS-CoV-2, targeting multiple positions in
              the viral genome. While the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is
              moderate, given the large number of transmission chains, it is
              prudent to monitor circulating viruses for variants that might
              compromise these assays. Here, we report the identification of a
              C-to-U transition at position 26340 of the SARS-CoV-2 genome that
              is associated with failure of the cobas SARS-CoV-2 E gene qRT-PCR
              in eight patients. As the cobas SARS-CoV-2 assay targets two
              positions in the genome, the individuals carrying this variant
              were still called SARS-CoV-2 positive. Whole-genome sequencing of
              SARS-CoV-2 showed all to carry closely related viruses.
              Examination of viral genomes deposited on GISAID showed this
              mutation has arisen independently at least four times. This work
              highlights the necessity of monitoring SARS-CoV-2 for the
              emergence of single-nucleotide polymorphisms that might adversely
              affect RT-PCRs used in diagnostics. Additionally, it argues that

              human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), intestinal

              The 18S rRNA level in activated and resting PBMCs and intestinal

              normalization to 18S rRNA gave a result that satisfactorily
              reflected their mRNA expression levels per cell. In conclusion,
              18S rRNA was the most stable housekeeping gene and hence superior

               data and constants. As of version 2.14.0, Stan provides full
               Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models through Markov
               chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an
               adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized
               maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization
               methods such as the limited memory
               Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a
               platform for computing log densities and their gradients and
               Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as
               variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and marginal
               inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is
               set up so that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along
               with intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance
               probabilities, are easily accessible. Stan can be called from
               the command line using the cmdstan package, through R using the
               rstan package, and through Python using the pystan package. All
               three interfaces support sampling and optimization-based
               inference with diagnostics and posterior analysis. rstan and
               pystan also provide access to log probabilities, gradients,
               Hessians, parameter transforms, and specialized plotting.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUNDSince December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease
              2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
              coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, and is now becoming
              a global threat. We aimed to delineate and compare the
              immunological features of severe and moderate COVID-19.METHODSIn
              this retrospective study, the clinical and immunological
              characteristics of 21 patients (17 male and 4 female) with
              COVID-19 were analyzed. These patients were classified as severe
              (11 cases) and moderate (10 cases) according to the guidelines
              released by the National Health Commission of China.RESULTSThe
              median age of severe and moderate cases was 61.0 and 52.0 years,
              respectively. Common clinical manifestations included fever,
              cough, and fatigue. Compared with moderate cases, severe cases
              more frequently had dyspnea, lymphopenia, and hypoalbuminemia,
              with higher levels of alanine aminotransferase, lactate
              dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, ferritin, and D-dimer as well
              as markedly higher levels of IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, and
              TNF-$\alpha$. Absolute numbers of T lymphocytes, CD4+ T cells,
              and CD8+ T cells decreased in nearly all the patients, and were
              markedly lower in severe cases (294.0, 177.5, and 89.0 $\times$
              106/L, respectively) than moderate cases (640.5, 381.5, and 254.0
              $\times$ 106/L, respectively). The expression of IFN-$\gamma$ by
              CD4+ T cells tended to be lower in severe cases (14.1\%) than in
              moderate cases (22.8\%).CONCLUSIONThe SARS-CoV-2 infection may
              affect primarily T lymphocytes, particularly CD4+ and CD8+ T
              cells, resulting in a decrease in numbers as well as IFN-$\gamma$
              production by CD4+ T cells. These potential immunological markers
              may be of importance because of their correlation with disease
              severity in COVID-19.TRIAL REGISTRATIONThis is a retrospective

               settings face severe limitations on testing. Group testing
               offers a way to increase throughput by testing pools of combined
               samples; however, most proposed designs have not yet addressed
               key concerns over sensitivity loss and implementation
               feasibility. Here, we combined a mathematical model of epidemic
               spread and empirically derived viral kinetics for SARS-CoV-2
               infections to identify pooling designs that are robust to
               changes in prevalence, and to ratify sensitivity losses against
               the time course of individual infections. We show that
               prevalence can be accurately estimated across a broad range,
               from 0.02\% to 20\%, using only a few dozen pooled tests, and
               using up to 400 times fewer tests than would be needed for
               individual identification. We then exhaustively evaluated the
               ability of different pooling designs to maximize the number of
               detected infections under various resource constraints, finding
               that simple pooling designs can identify up to 20 times as many
               true positives as individual testing with a given budget. We
               illustrate how pooling affects sensitivity and overall detection
               capacity during an epidemic and on each day post infection,
               finding that only 3\% of false negative tests occurred when
               individuals are sampled during the first week of infection
               following peak viral load, and that sensitivity loss is mainly
               attributable to individuals sampled at the end of infection when
               detection for limiting transmission has minimal benefit.
               Crucially, we confirmed that our theoretical results can be
               translated into practice using pooled human nasopharyngeal
               specimens by accurately estimating a 1\% prevalence among 2,304
               samples using only 48 tests, and through pooled sample
               identification in a panel of 960 samples. Our results show that
               accounting for variation in sampled viral loads provides a
               nuanced picture of how pooling affects sensitivity to detect
               infections. Using simple, practical group testing designs can
               vastly increase surveillance capabilities in resource-limited
               settings.",

              each step of nucleic acid amplification is necessary to prevent
              false-negative results due to inhibition or human error. In this
              study, we designed various real-time RT-PCRs utilizing the
              coliphage MS2 replicase gene, which differ in detection format,
              amplicon size, and efficiency of amplification. These

              duplex scorpion probe techniques, were tested on the LightCycler
              and Rotorgene systems. In our approach, clinical specimens were

                   Probabilistic programming languages make it easier to
                   specify and fit Bayesian models, but this still leaves us
                   with many options regarding constructing, evaluating, and
                   using these models, along with many remaining challenges in
                   computation. Using Bayesian inference to solve real-world
                   problems requires not only statistical skills, subject
                   matter knowledge, and programming, but also awareness of the
                   decisions made in the process of data analysis. All of these
                   aspects can be understood as part of a tangled workflow of
                   applied Bayesian statistics. Beyond inference, the workflow
                   also includes iterative model building, model checking,
                   validation and troubleshooting of computational problems,
                   model understanding, and model comparison. We review all
                   these aspects of workflow in the context of several
                   examples, keeping in mind that in practice we will be
                   fitting many models for any given problem, even if only a
                   subset of them will ultimately be relevant for our

              $\vartheta$1− $\vartheta$2) is calibrated using the Type 1 error
              rate, relying on the assumption that the true difference is zero,
              which makes no sense in many applications. We set up a more
              relevant framework in which a true comparison can be positive or
              negative, and, based on the data, you can state ``$\vartheta$1 >
              $\vartheta$2 with confidence,'' ``$\vartheta$2 > $\vartheta$1
              with confidence,'' or ``no claim with confidence.'' We focus on
              the Type S (for sign) error, which occurs when you claim
              ``$\vartheta$1 > $\vartheta$2 with confidence'' when
              $\vartheta$2> $\vartheta$1 (or vice-versa). We compute the Type S

              find that classical Type S error rates can be extremely high (up
              to 50\%). Bayesian confidence statements are conservative, in the
              sense that claims based on 95\% posterior intervals have Type S

              positive test results after negative tests and to multiple
              positive test results over time. The association between positive
              tests and infectious virus is important to quantify. METHODS: A
              two months cohort of retrospective data and consecutively
              collected specimens from COVID-19 patients or patients under
              investigation were used to understand the correlation between
              prolonged viral RNA positive test results, cycle threshold (Ct)
              values and growth of SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture. Whole genome
              sequencing was used to confirm virus genotype in patients with
              prolonged viral RNA detection. Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) was
              used to assess the rate of false negative COVID-19 diagnostic
              tests. RESULTS: In two months, 29,686 specimens were tested and
              2,194 patients received repeated testing. Virus recovery in cell
              culture was noted in specimens with SARS-CoV-2 target genes' Ct
              value average of 18.8 $\pm$ 3.4. Prolonged viral RNA shedding was
              associated with positive virus growth in culture in specimens
              collected up to 20 days after the first positive result but
              mostly in individuals symptomatic at time of sample collection.
              Whole genome sequencing provided evidence the same virus was
              carried over time. Positive tests following negative tests had Ct
              values higher than 29.5 and were not associated with virus
              culture. ddPCR was positive in 5.6\% of negative specimens
              collected from COVID-19 confirmed or clinically suspected
              patients. CONCLUSIONS: Low Ct values in SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic
              tests were associated with virus growth in cell culture.

              be infectious.",

                 Lipsitch, Marc and Mina, Michael J",
  abstract    = "Abstract Virologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 has been central to
                 the COVID-19 pandemic response, but interpreting changes in
                 incidence and fraction of positive tests towards understanding
                 the epidemic trajectory is confounded by changes in testing
                 practices. Here, we show that the distribution of viral loads,
                 in the form of Cycle thresholds (Ct), from positive
                 surveillance samples at a single point in time can provide
                 accurate estimation of an epidemic's trajectory, subverting
                 the need for repeated case count measurements which are
                 frequently obscured by changes in testing capacity. We
                 identify a relationship between the population-level
                 cross-sectional distribution of Ct values and the growth rate
                 of the epidemic, demonstrating how the skewness and median of
                 detectable Ct values change purely as a mathematical
                 epidemiologic rule without any change in individual level
                 viral load kinetics or testing. Although at the individual
                 level measurement variation can complicate interpretation of
                 Ct values for clinical use, we show that population-level
                 properties reflect underlying epidemic dynamics. In support of
                 these theoretical findings, we observe a strong relationship
                 between the time-varying effective reproductive number, R(t) ,
                 and the distribution of Cts among positive surveillance
                 specimens, including median and skewness, measured in
                 Massachusetts over time. We use the observed relationships to
                 derive a novel method that allows accurate inference of
                 epidemic growth rate using the distribution of Ct values
                 observed at a single cross-section in time, which, unlike
                 estimates based on case counts, is less susceptible to biases
                 from delays in test results and from changing testing
                 practices. Our findings suggest that instead of discarding
                 individual Ct values from positive specimens, incorporation of
                 viral loads into public health data streams offers a new
                 approach for real-time resource allocation and assessment of
                 outbreak mitigation strategies, even where repeat incidence
                 data is not available. Ct values or similar viral load data
                 should be regularly reported to public health officials by
                 testing centers and incorporated into monitoring programs.",

              societies and the control of virus spread will be facilitated by
              robust surveillance, for which virus testing will often be
              central. After infection, individuals undergo a period of
              incubation during which viral titers are usually too low to

               Stan builds readers' knowledge of and confidence in statistical
               modeling. Reflecting the need for even minor programming in
               today's model-based statistics, the book pushes readers to
               perform step-by-step calculations that are usually automated.
               This unique computational approach ensures that readers
               understand enough of the details to make reasonable choices and
               interpretations in their own modeling work. The text presents
               generalized linear multilevel models from a Bayesian
               perspective, relying on a simple logical interpretation of
               Bayesian probability and maximum entropy. It covers from the
               basics of regression to multilevel models. The author also
               discusses measurement error, missing data, and Gaussian process
               models for spatial and network autocorrelation. By using
               complete R code examples throughout, this book provides a
               practical foundation for performing statistical inference.
               Designed for both PhD students and seasoned professionals in the
               natural and social sciences, it prepares them for more advanced
               or specialized statistical modeling. Web ResourceThe book is
               accompanied by an R package (rethinking) that is available on
               the author's website and GitHub. The two core functions (map and
               map2stan) of this package allow a variety of statistical models

              Using population-level data, we show that measles has a more
              prolonged effect on host resistance, extending over 2 to 3 years.
              We find that nonmeasles infectious disease mortality in
              high-income countries is tightly coupled to measles incidence at
              this lag, in both the pre- and post-vaccine eras. We conclude
              that long-term immunologic sequelae of measles drive interannual
              fluctuations in nonmeasles deaths. This is consistent with recent
              experimental work that attributes the immunosuppressive effects
              of measles to depletion of B and T lymphocytes. Our data provide
              an explanation for the long-term benefits of measles vaccination

              of 326 289 971 US residents (54.8\%). Median (interquartile
              range) population density was 1022.7 (471.2-1846.0) people per
              square mile. The mean (SD) peak reduction in visits to
              nonessential business between April 6 and April 19, as the
              country was sheltering in place, was 68.7\% (7.9\%). Median
              (interquartile range) daily wet-bulb temperatures were 7.5
              (3.8-12.8) °C. Median (interquartile range) case incidence and
              fatality rates per 100 000 people were approximately 10 times
              higher for the top decile of densely populated counties (1185.2
              [313.2-1891.2] cases; 43.7 [10.4-106.7] deaths) than for counties
              in the lowest density quartile (121.4 [87.8-175.4] cases; 4.2
              [1.9-8.0] deaths). Mean (SD) Rt in the first 2 weeks was 5.7
              (2.5) in the top decile compared with 3.1 (1.2) in the lowest
              quartile. In multivariable analysis, a 50\% decrease in visits to
              nonessential businesses was associated with a 45\% decrease in Rt
              (95\% CI, 43\%-49\%). From a relative Rt at 0 °C of 2.13 (95\%
              CI, 1.89-2.40), relative Rt decreased to a minimum as
              temperatures warmed to 11 °C, increased between 11 and 20 °C
              (1.61; 95\% CI, 1.42-1.84) and then declined again at
              temperatures greater than 20 °C. With a 70\% reduction in visits
              to nonessential business, 202 counties (95.7\%) were estimated to
              fall below a threshold Rt of 1.0, including 17 of 21 counties
              (81.0\%) in the top density decile and 52 of 53 counties (98.1\%)
              in the lowest density quartile.2. Conclusions and Relevance: In
              this cohort study, social distancing, lower population density,
              and temperate weather were associated with a decreased Rt for
              SARS-CoV-2 in counties across the United States. These
              associations could inform selective public policy planning in
              communities during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.",

              Little is known about the kinetics, tissue distribution,
              cross-reactivity, and neutralization antibody response in
              patients with COVID-19. Two groups of patients with
              RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in this study: 12
              severely ill patients in intensive care units who needed
              mechanical ventilation and 11 mildly ill patients in isolation
              wards. Serial clinical samples were collected for laboratory
              detection. Results showed that most of the severely ill patients
              had viral shedding in a variety of tissues for 20-40 days after
              onset of disease (8/12, 66.7\%), while the majority of mildly ill
              patients had viral shedding restricted to the respiratory tract
              and had no detectable virus RNA 10 days after onset (9/11,
              81.8\%). Mildly ill patients showed significantly lower IgM
              response compared with that of the severe group. IgG responses
              were detected in most patients in both the severe and mild groups
              at 9 days after onset, and remained at a high level throughout
              the study. Antibodies cross-reactive to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2
              were detected in patients with COVID-19 but not in patients with
              MERS. High levels of neutralizing antibodies were induced after
              about 10 days after onset in both severely and mildly ill
              patients which were higher in the severe group. SARS-CoV-2
              pseudotype neutralization test and focus reduction neutralization
              test with authentic virus showed consistent results. Sera from
              patients with COVID-19 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry. Sera from
              convalescent patients with SARS or Middle East respiratory
              syndrome (MERS) did not. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S and N IgG levels
              exhibited a moderate correlation with neutralization titers in
              patients' plasma. This study improves our understanding of immune
